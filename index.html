    <h1>Personal Information</h1>
    <p>My name is Benjamin Finn however I usually prefer Ben or just Finny. I was born and have lived in Australia my entire life. My dad is Australian, and my mum is English. I do not speak any other languages.
</p>
    <p>I am a fan of Association football (soccer) and Formula 1 among other sports. Liverpool FC, Adelaide United and Williams Racing are the individual teams that I support.
  </p>
    <p>I have two pet dogs that live with me called Bonnie and Wampiti. They are both girls, mixed breeds and aged 16 and 10 respectively.  </p>

  <h1>Interest in IT?</h1>
  <p>My interest in IT primarily came from PC gaming. This led to modding games and investigating hardware. Combined with an existing curiosity in electronics and programming, an interest in IT was a natural progression. I have since built my own PC and helped others as well. I also briefly studied engineering science at flinders university and encountered some coding during that.  </p>
  <p> My previous study experience had made it clear to myself that I prefer to study online when possible. So, through open universities I found this course from RMIT and decided to explore it further.  </p>
  <p> I am hoping that in studying this course I will possibly gain the knowledge for a career in the IT profession but would hope at least to expand my knowledge of IT, to increase my literacy in a world that increasingly relies upon it. I would also hope to learn skills and programming languages that allow me the freedom to create personal projects that are of interest to me. </p>

    <h1>Personality Tests</h1>
    <p>My result in the Myers-Brigg’s personality test was INTP-A, an Assertive Logician
Introverted, I find this very accurate as I consider myself very reserved and generally cautious. While I do not often seek out large social interactions, I do enjoy the ones I already commit too, even if I find the experience draining. I am very content with extended periods of alone.
Intuitive, again I would agree as I often enjoy discussing views and theories as well as their implementation in deeply hypothetical scenarios. This can often lead to a train of thought being far from the most practical, and I may drift off into thought mid conversation.
Thinking, preferring to gather knowledge and information to rationalise before committing to a decision. While often true, I will also just decide on a whim sometimes and stick to it, so I don’t feel this as strongly.
Prospecting, I can often be overwhelmed by many options and as such may be slow to commit. Combined with a lack of conviction in the decision I do make leads this area to be a personal weakness and something I endeavour to improve.
 </p>
    <p>My Honey and Mumford learning styles are theorist and reflector. This suggests that I like to learn both by observing and thinking about what has happened and understanding the theory behind it. Collecting data to analyse and create a logical theory. This does resonate with how I like to do a lot of my learning, but elements of the other styles are also valuable and should still be used when appropriate. </p>
    <p>My final personality test was for a Hogwarts house, the result of which was Hufflepuff. This suggests that I am patient, loyal, nice and hardworking. While I doubt hardworking is accurate, 3 out of 4 isn’t bad, and probably as accurate as most personality tests. </p>

  <h1> Ideal Job </h1>
<p><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/56261054?type=standout#sol=6bfab3ee3c3c1c665a349c159a2f6e3219a43a71"> Job posting here </a></p>
<p>This job is the implementation and maintenance of computer systems and providing IT support throughout the company. A position such as this is appealing to me as it is available in a wide range of locations outside major cities, providing flexibility in lifestyle.  </p>
<p>Such a position requires a qualification such as Bachelor of Information Technology, as well as some experience in the field of IT support. This is more that my current experience, which is none.
In order to get this position or similar I will complete my current course. Then I will likely find a position with a similar skillset working in a group or under someone more experienced. This will then allow me to have the skills to work in a position where I may be the only one in my field. </p>

  <h1> Project Idea </h1>
  <p>Whilst playing the 2018 game ‘A way out’ with a friend of mine there was a mini game of connect 4 that we played. I proceeded to lose this game more than 10 times in a row, to much frustration. On several occasions since then I have still failed to win, so I conclude that I am terrible at this game. Because I believe everyone should feel the sting of defeat, I am sure that it would be entertaining to create unwinnable games that everyone would lose. </p>
  <p>I am proposing to create one or a collection of unwinnable games. They would keep track of successive defeats, or perhaps time without a win. It could also laugh or mock the player in some way after each separate loss. </p>
  <p>In order to create unwinnable games (without cheating), we must use games that have been ‘solved’. Meaning there is a perfect way to play that ensures a certain outcome, usually a win or draw. Connect 4 is one such game, others include Tic-tac-toe and checkers, which have varying degrees of complexity. If creating a collection of unwinnable games, a menu would be needed to select and individual game to play, this would also be a sensible place to display the statistics such as losing streaks. </p>
  <p>Using connect 4 as an example it would appear like the existing game, in a digital space. This involves a 7x6 grid in which players take turns in placing tokens in any available column that would ‘fall’ to the lowest available row. The winner being the 1st to create an unbroken line of 4 of their tokens vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. The game could also function at this point as a multiplayer game where people play against each other if that functionality was desired. The solution to the game in this case it means that by perfect play the player who goes 1st will always win. Our bot will therefore go first and follow the necessary steps to produce perfect play. These steps would be dictated by a mathematical proof that must be converted into a structure of code. </p>
  <p>I believe that software such as unity may be a way to create such a thing. Unity is free to use for students and therefore accessible for the purposes here. As solving the game individually would prove both difficult and time consuming, one would presumably refer to an existing solution such as Victor Allis’s “A Knowledge-based Approach of Connect-Four”. </p>
  <p>The skills required for such a task would include some proficiency with unity which has many online tutorials. Additionally, some mathematically literacy would also be assumed to understand the solution to some of the more complex games. Finally experience programming in whatever the applicable language is would be needed to translate the strategy into a decision-making algorithm. Learning resources for mainstream languages are readily available online. </p>
  <p>The simplest version of this product would be a Tic-Tac-Toe bot that plays perfectly to never lose. There is a large scope for growth with a menu system and several other mini games that could be added to create a collection of more complex games. </p>
